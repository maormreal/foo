Ah, it seems like you're describing the "Press and Hold" feature on macOS, which displays a popup of accented characters when you hold down a key.

To disable this feature and restore normal key behavior without the popup, you can use a command in the Terminal. Here's how:

Open Terminal on your Mac. You can find it in the "Utilities" folder within the "Applications" folder, or you can search for it using Spotlight (Cmd + Space, then type "Terminal" and press Enter).

In the Terminal window, paste the following command and press Enter:

bash
Copy code
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
After running the command, you might need to restart any applications where you want the changes to take effect. This includes applications like VS Code.

Once you've done this, the "Press and Hold" feature should be disabled, and holding down a key will repeat the character without showing the popup of accented characters. If you ever want to re-enable the feature, you can run the following command in Terminal:

bash
Copy code
defaults write -g ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool true
